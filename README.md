# 🚀 Featured Project: Daily Quote Generator
I created a Python-based Daily Quote Generator. Here is how it works:

### 🛠️ The Code:
```python
import random

quotes = [
    "Believe you can and you're halfway there.",
    "Do what you can with what you have, wherever you are.",
    "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue.",
    "Dream big and dare to fail.",
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
]

def get_random_quote():
    return random.choice(quotes)

print(f"✨ Quote: {get_random_quote()}")
